The Problem: 
I am looking to open a high-end Asian restaurant in Tel-Aviv, Israel. I am unsure as of where I should open it, as there are a couple of specific issues that bother me:
1. I want my restaurant to stand out from the crowd, meaning that if there are many Asian restaurants in my area, it would negatively affect my business traffic and cause customer loss with fierce competition.
2. On the other hand, if my restaurant is located in a quiet and/or neglected area, or rather a very noisy and industrial area, it would not attract any customers either.
3. Moreover - Since my restaurant is going to be a high-end restaurant, I need it to be close to an affluent neighbourhood(s) so as to attract affluent customers.
4. Accessibility is still important - I'd still like my restaurant to be relatively accessible, thus not located at the edge of the city or far from main roads.
